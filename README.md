## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

<ul>
    <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
    <li>CSS manipulation</li>
    <li>HTML event methods</li>
    <li>Effects and animations</li>
    <li>AJAX</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
